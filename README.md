JACKS Tools: Quick Link Launcher
Simple, Easy to use, Link director.

Input the URL, make a name, add a group, whatever.
Your links will be saved and will be able to used later.

This is especially useful if you need to open multiple links at a time, just select a group with multiple links, and click 'Open Link'
